### Social Media Analytics
##### 

Created a social media EDA project using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. The project involved generating random tweet data, exploring and cleaning it, and then visualizing and analyzing it.

**Key Findings:**

1. The random data generation process allowed us to simulate a diverse set of social media interactions across different categories, including Food, Travel, Fashion, Fitness, Music, Culture, Family, and Health.

2. Data exploration revealed valuable insights into the distribution of likes across categories, helping identify trends and patterns.

3. The data cleaning process ensured the removal of null values and duplicates, making the dataset more suitable for analysis.

4. Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib provided a clear understanding of the data, with histograms showing the distribution of likes and boxplots highlighting variations between different categories.

5. Statistical analysis, including calculating the mean likes overall and for each category, provided a quantitative summary of the dataset.
